The moment I ran into Jekyll, I immediately realized the power it could into the hands of the creator. You can finally 'own' your content. Your blog is managed using git and push to github.

The workflow is as simple

*   Create content in markdown
*   Generate static pages using jekyll
*   Push to github

## So why Jekyll?

One it's Ruby based. Just install the jekyll gem and you are ready to go. Two, you manage everything via git and that is something I am already using anyway, everyday. Three, once setup, all you need is just type in markdown, again something I am used to doing anyway.

Jekyll also offers some really cool support for code snippets.If you like comments, you can also integrate jekyll with Disqus.

Over the next couple of weeks I plan to convert all posts from the last three years to markdown using jekyll to generate static pages.

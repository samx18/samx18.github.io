Despite the fact that email ranks number one on the list of top time suckers, it may not be practical to completely avoid email. But is there a way we can minimize the damage and turn it into an asset? Yes – with a little common sense and some basic rules that I have been diligently following. Taking a clue from the agile manifesto, I decided to put them in the same format and set-up a my own email manifesto which I solemnly swear to abide by and hopefully will be able to influence a few good people to adopt the manifesto as well along the way.
## The Manifesto
* Will explore and exhaust **all other communication channels** before choosing to email. Including but not limited an in person communication, a phone call or an IM chat.
* Check and process email only at specific times of the day or better specific days.
* Will maintain a **zero inbox** daily or as often you check and process email.
* **Use email just as a communication tool**. Email shall not be used to store and retrieve information as document management or as a task management system.
* All email will have a **clear and a specific subject** and the content in the email will stick to that subject and only that subject.
* Will be **mindful when including attachments** in email. Including both type and size of the attachments.
* **Will NOT SPAM**, will be mindful when doing a ‘Reply All’ and when forwarding email messages.
* Emails **threads will be limited to 5 or less**. If a subject cannot be covered or resolved within 5 email threads it will be taken off to a different forum.
* Will include the only the people whom the email is addressed to in the TO section. Will use the CC section only in rare cases and **will NOT use the Blind Carbon Copy (bcc) option**.
* Will **not be disrespectful,abusive,coercive, dishonest, manipulative or misrepresent facts** in my emails.

## Live Manifesto
In the spirit of keeping this manifesto live and flexible your feedback will be very helpful. Would like to hear if you agree/ disagree or want to add in to the manifesto. If nothing else signing the manifesto would be cool as well
